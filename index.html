    <p>Hello there, and welcome to my homepage!<br><br>

        My name is <a href="/">Aritra Chakrabarty</a>, and I am an Indian Astrophysicist specializing in exoplanet
        research.
        I am currently a <a href="https://npp.orau.org/experiences/current-fellows.html/">NASA Postdoctoral Program
            (NPP) Fellow</a> working at
        <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/ames/">NASA Ames Research Center</a>.
        <br><br>

        My current research centers on the demographics of small exoplanets,
        including the search for potential Earth 2.0 candidates. I work extensively with Kepler mission data, refining
        the pipeline and reanalyzing raw data with the core mission team. This enhanced approach targets the
        mission's sensitive regimes and edge cases, aiming to recover additional Earth-sized planets in habitable
        zonesâ€”regions where liquid water could exist. I also work with theories of planet formation and evolution as
        well as population models, seeking to understand how current statistics of exoplanets can inform us of how they
        formed and evolved in the past. Fun fact: I also explore the possibility of the existence of water worlds!
        <br><br>

        Additionally, I develop and work with atmospheric and radiative transfer models to generate captivating
        simulations of spectral and polarization signals emanating from exoplanets. This knowledge opens pathways to
        probe the atmospheres of these distant worlds by leveraging advances in observational technology.
        <br><br>

        All these works demand advanced statistical modeling, numerical simulations, and cutting-edge data processing
        techniques to push the boundaries of our understanding of the distant worlds.
        <br><br>

        Visit the <a href="/research">research</a> page to explore my current projects and discover fascinating insights about
        exoplanets. You can also check out my ongoing work on <a href="https://github.com/aritrachakrabarty/">Github</a>
        and see the latest developments in exoplanet data analysis. For a comprehensive overview of my background and
        experience, please have a look at my <a href="/cv">curriculum vitae</a>.<br><br>

        I am also associated with the <a href="https://dataobservatory.net/team/">Data Observatory</a> in Chile, where I
        previously worked.</p>
